# The Archaea Terraria Mod
A modification project for use with the Terraria tModLoader API.

## Summary
This is the official repository for the project. The old repositories at https://github.com/700hours/AM_TestEnvironment (unofficial developement repo) and https://github.com/700hours/Archaea-Mod (official release repo) are now mainly archives.

## Info
For now, even if the code is migrated from the old repos, whether or not you're a collaborator, pushing commits to the dev branch is encouraged.
